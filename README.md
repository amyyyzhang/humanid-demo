# humanID Log-in Demo

## Overview 
 
Meet humanID - An anonymous online identity, enabling platforms to offer the speed and comfort of social logins, while guaranteeing absolute privacy and protecting our communities by permanently blocking bots, spams, and trolls.

## Goal 
Changing the implementation of humanID’s login within our website, with the purpose of demonstrating the ease of our user experience to potential clients, users, and anyone else trying to find out what humanID is. 
The demo as integrated on the website is confusing people, primarily because of the post-demo communication (feels like “it didn’t work”), potentially also (though to a lesser extend) because of the “Filmreview” communication, and the button leading into the demo.
